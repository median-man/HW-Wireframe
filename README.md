# HW Wireframe
This is an exercise in creating a wireframe with html and css. The layout is based on a simple image with a few specifications for the size of certain elements.

There are two branches, 'redo' and 'master'. I first created the master branch. Then, nearly 4 months later, I did the exercise yet again from blank files to compare the differences in my solution.
